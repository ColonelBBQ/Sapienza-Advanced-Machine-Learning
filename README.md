# Traffic Accident Prediction Using GNNs with Slope Feature 🚦

## Overview

This project builds upon the ML4RoadSafety repository, which applies Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict traffic accidents. While the original model used road network and meteorological features, our contribution introduces slope as an additional feature to improve predictive performance.

By incorporating slope data into the edge features, we observed a 60 basis point improvement in AUROC, demonstrating the significance of elevation changes in accident prediction.

## Key Enhancements in This Fork

✅ Feature Engineering: Added a new slope feature for edges, calculated using elevation data.
✅ Improved AUROC: The addition of slope increased AUROC from 82.62% to 83.22%.
✅ Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Developed scripts to retrieve elevation data and compute slope efficiently.

## Dataset Modifications

The dataset used is sourced from Harvard Dataverse, covering Montana traffic data (2016-2020). The new slope feature was derived using the Open-Elevation API and added to the edge features tensor.

The slope for each edge was computed as:

\text{slope} = \frac{E_{\text{target}} - E_{\text{source}}}{L}

Where:
	•	 E_{\text{target}}  and  E_{\text{source}}  are the elevations of the target and source nodes, respectively.
	•	 L  is the road segment length.

New Scripts in This Fork

The following scripts were added to the dataset processing pipeline:

📂 slope_inclusion/ (New folder for slope processing)
	•	9_elevation_dataset_modification.py → Retrieves elevation data using the Open-Elevation API.
	•	8_batches_split.py → Splits dataset into manageable batches for elevation API calls.
	•	10_nodes_elevation_concat.py → Integrates elevation data with node features.
	•	11_edge_slope_inclusion.py → Computes slope values for each edge in the road network.

## Model & Training

The GNN model used a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with:
	•	2 graph convolutional layers
	•	256 hidden dimensions
	•	Learning rate: 0.001
	•	Optimized with Adam
	•	Trained over 100 epochs

The training and testing splits remained consistent with the original study:
	•	Training: 2016–2017
	•	Validation: 2018
	•	Testing: 2019–2020

## Results

Adding slope improved AUROC, especially on the test set (+60 basis points):

| Metric          | Model - Slope | Model - No Slope | Improvement (b.p) |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Train AUROC** | 83.31 ± 0.35 | 82.99 ± 0.15 | +32 |
| **Valid AUROC** | 83.03 ± 0.12 | 82.73 ± 0.04 | +30 |
| **Test AUROC** | 83.22 ± 0.30 | 82.62 ± 0.21 | **+60** |
| **Test Precision** | 8.13 ± 2.77 | 5.26 ± 1.25 | **+287** |
| **Test Recall** | 47.14 ± 8.47 | 52.01 ± 1.34 | **-487** |

## Future Work

🚀 Improve elevation data accuracy (use Google Maps API for better resolution)
🚀 Optimize slope feature encoding (categorical bins: flat, mild, steep)
🚀 Test across different states to generalize findings
